      <h2>What the future holds</h2>
      <p>
        I am thrilled to be starting the Web Development Immersive course at
        Galvanize!!
      </p>
      <p>
        My goal is to make the most of my time at Galvanize and acquire new
        skills, develop a personal portfolio, and gain experience working on
        collaborative tech projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        I know that there'll be hard work, but I think it will also be a lot of
        fun! I hope to learn a lot, find many new friends amongst my fellow
        Galvanizers, and be a good teammate!
      </p>
      <p>
        After graduation I would like to work as a software engineer. I would
        like to find work at a company that will be a good fit for my set of
        skills and professional experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am looking forward to the new challenges that await as well as the
        opportunities to be creative, learn, and do something new every day.
        This is going to be exciting, and I am ready to
        <span class="capitalize">start</span>!
